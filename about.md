I work at [Build.com](http://build.com/) as a senior mobile developer. Our team is currently developing the tablet and mobile experiences for the Build.com network of stores.

I like to work on open source projects as I have time. I've worked on a few projects like [Buckets](https://github.com/asm-products/buckets) and [BossyUI](https://github.com/buildcom/BossyUI). Oh, and I'm a [jQuery contributor](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt#L198).
